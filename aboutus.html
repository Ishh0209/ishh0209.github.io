	    <h2>Our Mission Statement</h2>
<p class= "mission">We guarantee all your space exploration dreams will come true when you fly with us. </p>
    
<h2>Our History</h2>
    <p class= "home">Blast Off was founded by thousands of astronauts with the idea of bringing space travel into the future. Our company is at the forefront of all modern space travel, with our continuous efforts to make traveling more safe and accessible for all. Blast Off has been flight-testing our safety systems since 2010. This includes several successful missions with test subjects. We have been in the space tourism business since 2018. We had a successful launch and have been expanding our business with better vehicles and a bigger variety of packages. </p>
	    <h2>Our Impact</h2>
	    <p class = "home">We have been able to provide a once-in-a-lifetime experience for over 25,000 people. We did have to stop trips for a while as Covid had spread all around the world. During this time we allowed those infected to use our facilities to have a healthy recovery. After it was safe, we expanded even more due to our social media posts and advertising. Our waitlist got to be longer than 2 years. It is now sitting at 1 year long as we have been able to create a great system for all of our flights. We can donate additional proceeds to continue space exploration as it is such a huge part of the future. </p>
